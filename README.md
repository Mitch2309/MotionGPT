# MotionGPT
Bachelor AI project.
This GitHub only consists of the NLP analysis using the BERT_model in BERT.py.
It is a local code because data can be confidential.

Download the prompt data (GPTPrompt and DiffPrompt) from the spreadsheet with all the Qualtrics data on Google Drive (see Appendix of thesis) to  local CSV files.

Input the right file path and storage location in the code.
Run separately for both the GPT prompt file and the Diffusion Prompt file.
